      Product design is a complex process that involves multiple stages,
      from coming up with an idea to putting it into practice. In order to
      ensure the success of a product, it's important to understand and
      follow a structured design process. Here's a step-by-step guide to
      the product design process, from ideation to implementation.

    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>1. Ideation</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in the product design process is to come up with an
        idea. This can come from a variety of sources, such as market
        research, customer feedback, or simply a personal passion or
        interest. The key is to identify a need or opportunity that can be
        filled with a new product.

    </div>

    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>2. Research and Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have an idea, it's time to research and analyze the
        market to determine if there is a demand for your product. This
        stage involves identifying your target audience, researching your
        competitors, and assessing the feasibility of your idea.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>3. Concept Development</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've completed your research, it's time to start developing
        your concept. This involves creating a rough sketch of your
        product, as well as identifying any potential challenges or
        obstacles that may need to be addressed in the design process.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>4. Prototype Development</h3>
      <p>
        The next step is to create a prototype of your product. This can
        be as simple as a hand-drawn sketch or as complex as a 3D printed
        model. The goal of this stage is to bring your concept to life and
        test it in a real-world setting
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>5. User Testing</h3>
      <p>
        User testing is an essential part of the product design process.
        It involves gathering feedback from real users to determine how
        well your product is working and identify any areas that need
        improvement. This stage is critical to ensuring the success of
        your product, as it helps you identify and address any usability
        issues before launch.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>6. Refinement</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the feedback you received during user testing, it's time
        to refine your product. This stage involves making any necessary
        changes or improvements to your product to ensure it meets the
        needs of your users.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>7. Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The final stage of the product design process is implementation.
        This involves bringing your product to market, whether that be
        through mass production or a small-scale launch. This stage also
        includes marketing and promoting your product, as well as
        providing customer support and maintenance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Following a structured design process can help ensure the success of
      your product. By following these steps, you can take your idea from
      ideation to implementation and create a product that meets the needs
      of your users and exceeds their expectations.

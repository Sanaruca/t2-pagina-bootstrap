    <p>
      As a product designer, one of your main goals is to create an
      interface that is intuitive and easy for users to navigate. A
      well-designed user interface can make all the difference in the
      success of a product. Here are five key elements that can help you
      create an intuitive user interface.
    </p>

    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>Simplicity</h3>
      <p>
        A simple and straightforward interface is easier for users to
        understand and navigate. This can be achieved through the use of
        clear and concise labeling, a minimalistic design, and a
        consistent layout.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Consistent design elements, such as color, typography, and icons,
        help users understand where they are within the interface and what
        actions they can take. This can increase user confidence and
        reduce confusion.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        Providing feedback to users helps them understand what is
        happening within the interface. This can be done through visual
        cues, such as animations or notifications, or through audio cues,
        such as sounds or vibrations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>Usability</h3>
      <p>
        A usable interface allows users to achieve their goals with ease.
        This can be achieved through thoughtful design decisions, such as
        placing frequently used actions in easily accessible locations and
        making sure that actions are clearly labeled.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="article__content__div">
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        An accessible interface is usable by as many people as possible,
        regardless of any disabilities they may have. This can be achieved
        through the use of alternative methods of navigation, such as
        keyboard-only navigation, and by ensuring that all visual elements
        have sufficient contrast.
